# PowerBi-Project
### Project Overview
The gaming industry has witnessed significant growth, with millions of players engaging in a wide range of games on platforms like Steam. As one of the largest hubs for digital PC gaming, Steam hosts thousands of games across various genres. In this project, we utilize a dataset featuring 27,000 Steam games sourced from Steam and SteamSpy APIs to uncover key insights into popular game genres, player preferences, and the factors driving the growth of specific genres.
This project contains the code, dataset, and Power BI dashboard for analyzing and visualizing these trends.
